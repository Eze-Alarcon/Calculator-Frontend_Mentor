### What I learned

I did this project right after finishing my JavaScript course at "CoderHouse" and after taking several add-on courses at "Platzi". Thanks to these courses I decided to start this project. 

At the beginning it was a bit difficult, thinking of a way to solve the problem while I had my mind on other problems of everyday life was a bit challenging but in the end I came up with a solution. To this day it may not be the best solution, for sure there are thousands of implementations better done than the one exposed in this project but this also serves as a reminder that "it is always better to do something than nothing". 

### Continued development

To this day I still think about the implementation I did for this project. I haven't changed it and I honestly don't think I will because a certain part of me wants to expose that even though it's not the best code, it does the job.
