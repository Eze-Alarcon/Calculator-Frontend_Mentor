### What I learned

I did this project right after finishing my JavaScript course at "CoderHouse" and after taking several add-on courses at "Platzi". Thanks to these courses I decided to start this project.

At the beginning it was a bit difficult, thinking of a way to solve the problem while I had my mind on other problems of everyday life was a bit challenging but in the end I came up with a solution.

### Continued development

After learning a lot about how the language works, good practices and more related topics, I found some points to improve.

Details like refactoring the code, variable names and even the implementation were details that maybe at the time I overlooked but not today.

Nevertheless, the challenge was completed.
